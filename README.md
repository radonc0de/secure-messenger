# A Secure Messaging App #

This started as a final project for a Network Security class, but I decided to go beyond that and add some more features to it to learn some more cryptography concepts.

### Diffie-Hellman ###

Diffie-Hellman class takes arguments of p, alpha, and a private secret integer. If no inputs are supplied, a default p and alpha are used and a secret integer is generated. After this, a public key for the user is generated. This class also contains a function for determining the shared secret, given that another user (with the same p and alpha) has supplied their public key.
